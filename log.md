### Day 77: 24/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Hackathon (presentation day): Polishing off some functionalities and CSS of the "React Flashcards" project in the morning then prep for presentation. Our team received a brilliant feedback especially for taking the extra mile deploying the project for public access
**Thoughts:** Very happy with my team's performance, the project's outcome and most of all the fantastic feedback we received, thanks team!

### Day 78: 25/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: Added filtering functionality to the GET request so it can filter by date now, also added a "health check" route for future use once deployed
**Thoughts:** I looked at Render.com for deploying my project but it's not there yet...

### Day 79: 26/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: Added/upgraded a graceful and more informative error handling and separeted better "no match" cases to actual errors
**Thoughts:** I had to stop to rethink what is an actual error and what is a succesful response with no matches returned

### Day 80: 27/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: Set up tests using vitest and supertest; set up mocking a database and that the API health check comes back positive
**Thoughts:** A lot of hurdles to make it actualy work, for example the issue ending pool before test by accident costing hours to figure out

### Day 81: 28/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: Added http GET request tests for all elements and by ID; there's still some work with the GET elements by date filter test, it's not quite there yet
**Thoughts:** I looked into RegEx and I will implement it tomorrow, fascinating tool

### Day 82: 29/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: The GET elements by date filter test is working fine now, also added DELETE by ID test
**Thoughts:** I was on the wrong path yesterday about the filter one, it was such a simple solution makes it look like I barely did anyting...

### Day 83: 30/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Hackathon: Task was to create anything utilising what we had learned about web engineering and before; Our team decided to make a single page song selector application. We used React, Material UI, HTML, CSS, states, props, hooks, flexbox, grid and so on.
**Thoughts:** Well planned out at the beginnig helping us through the whole project, polishing off in the morning then presentation time.

### Day 84: 31/01/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Hackathon (presentation day): Finishing off some of the functionalities to fully complete MVP 1, 2 and 3 for the presentation. The song list with a grid layout got replaced by a Material UI / eMotion carousel component that ended up with a bug unfortunately
**Thoughts:** Due to lack of time the bug stayed in it for now but I have a pretty good idea what it is and how to fix it.

### Day 85: 01/02/2025 ###

**Today's Progress:** Blog API: Added POST and PATCH by ID request tests to have a complete CRUD test in place
**Thoughts:** It may need a little polishing off when it comes to comparing dates with .toMatchObject().
